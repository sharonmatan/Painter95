# Paint 95

4th Assignment at Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp (Week 4).

In this assignment, I created my own version of Paint 95.
In my painter, the user can choose his favorite color, adjust the brush size, use an eraser, change the painting background color. 

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
